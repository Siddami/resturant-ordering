# Restaurant Ordering App

This is a solo project for the [Scrimba Frontend Career Essentials Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend).  
It is a simple restaurant ordering web app that allows users to browse a menu, add items to their order, remove items, and complete their order with a payment form.

## Project Idea

The goal of this project is to simulate a real-world restaurant ordering experience:

- Users can view a menu of items (with emoji, name, ingredients, and price).
- Users can add items to their order and adjust quantities.
- Users can remove items from their order.
- When ready, users can complete their order by filling out a payment form in a modal.
- After successful payment, a confirmation modal is shown.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core logic, DOM manipulation, classes, constructors, and event handling.
- **HTML5**: Markup structure.
- **CSS3**: Styling, Flexbox for layout, and responsive design with mobile-first approach and media queries.
- **Vite**: Development server and build tool.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons.

## What I Learned

### JavaScript Concepts

- **Classes & Constructors**: Used to encapsulate menu and order logic, making the code modular and reusable.
- **Setting Functions in Constructors**: Methods like `renderMenu`, `renderOrder`, and `showModal` are defined in the class for clear structure.
- **Form Handling & Verification**: Implemented a payment form inside a modal, with required fields and basic validation before submission.
- **Event Handling**: Added event listeners for adding/removing items and handling form submission.
- **Dynamic DOM Manipulation**: Created and updated HTML elements dynamically based on user actions.

### CSS & Layout

- **Flexbox**: Used for flexible and responsive layouts, aligning menu items and order summary.
- **Mobile-First Design**: Base styles are optimized for mobile, with media queries for tablets and desktops.
- **Custom Modals**: Built custom modal overlays for payment and confirmation messages.
